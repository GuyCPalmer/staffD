# Staff'd : Your personal staffing app 

## Overview
This app is designed to provide company's and individual event hosts the opportunity to hire local talent for staffing events. Users interested in working local events can create a account with the information event hosts are most interested in: their job interests, a bio, a photo, etc. Then it is as easy as creating an event and choosing the talent that works best for you.
