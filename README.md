# Staff'd : Your personal staffing app 

Overview
This app is designed to provide company's and individual event hosts the opportunity to hire local talent for staffing events. Users interested in working local events can create a account with the information event hosts are most interested in: their job interests, a bio, a photo, etc. Then it is as easy as creating an event and choosing the talent that works best for you.
